Thsi question is similar to Celebrity Problem.
But, here we are not given trust matrix, instead we are given trust relation, so, using stack and elimination approach can we memory specific operation
But, still process is :
    1)Form a N^2 matrix consisting all trust relations
    2)push all numbers from 1 to N into stack
    3)Repeat till stack size is greater than 1
        a)Pop 2 elements, a and b from stack
        b)If matrix[a][b] == 1, i.e a trusts b. So, we can say that a can't be judge. So we push b back to stack and continue
        c)else, push a back to stack and continue because matrixa[b] must be 0, which signifies that b don't know a, so a can't be judge
    4)Pop last element from stack and store it in variable and run a O(N) loop to confirm whether ans is correct or not. This is done by checking row and column corresponding to ans.
    Here, Time Complexity : O(N)
          Space Complexity : O(N^2)


Here, better approach can be to consider it as simple graph problem and calculate indegree and outdegree for every element.
The element whose indegree == N-1 and outdegree == 0 is judge

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity : O(N)
