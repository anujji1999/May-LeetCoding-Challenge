Here, we need two details to ensure that x and y are cousins or not:
    1) Height/ Depth of x and y
    2) Parent of x and y

So, there are many options : either return a pair OR use pass reference for Parent and return height/Depth from recursive function

So, i made variables parent1 and parent2 in main function and passed them by reference, so ultimately all changes in them will be reflected in main

Steps :-
    1) First, i checked if root->val == x OR root->val == y, then return false
    2) Then we called recursive function on the rroot to find the vaiable x and return it's height(Parent will be automatically updated as it is passed by reference)
    3) Step 2 is repeated for variable y
    4) If height1 == height2 && parent1 != parent2, return true
    5) return false

Since, in Java there is no option of pass by reference, So we many options : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-pass-integer-by-reference-in-java/

For Java, i created an array of size 1 and passed it in function, since arrays are passed via reference
